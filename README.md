# Simscape Hybrid Electric Vehicle Project

Version 1

Copyright 2021 The MathWorks, Inc.

## Introduction

This is a MATLAB Project containing a Hybrid Electric
Vehicle (HEV) model and its components such as
motor, high voltage battery, and longitudinal vehicle.
This project demonstrates Simscape's modular and
multi-fidelity modeling technology.

The HEV model is built in a simple and modular fashion,
and it can run faster than real-time.
It is suitable as a baseline model for drive cycle simulation
to estimate vehicle's electrical efficiency and
other vehicle-level information.

## Tool Requirements

Supported MATLAB Version: R2020b

Required: MATLAB, Simulink, Simscape, Simscape Driveline,
Simscape Electrical, Powertrain Blockset

## How to Use

Open `SimscapeHybridEV.prj` in MATLAB.
It will automatically open `HEV_main_script.mlx`.
The script contains hyperlinks to open the models,
parameter files, and simulation driver scripts.
