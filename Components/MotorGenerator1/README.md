# Motor Generator 1 Component

This is a model of motor drive unit
specifically parameterized for Motor Generator 1 (MG1),
which is used as part of power-split hybrid electric vehicle.
This component is designed to be used
as a reusable model.

The main block is in Simulink library file
`MotorGenerator1_refsub_library.mdl`.
Harness model `MotorGenerator1_Component_harness_model.mdl`
in the `Harness` folder is used to test the block.

This component depends on the Motor Drive Unit component.

## Test Cases

`TestCases` folder contains Live Scripts
that are used to visually inspect the simulation behaviors
of the model in various simulation scenarios as follows.

- Constant ...
  All inputs are constant.
  This is used to check that the harness model runs.

- Start engine ...
  MG1 starts engine.

- Generate ...
  MG1 converts engine's mechanical power
  to generate electric power.

- Stop engine ...
  Engine stops operating, and then
  MG1 tries to spin engine crank in the reverse direction
  which is prevented by sprag clutch.
