# Signal Source Block Library

This is a Simulink block library containing two blocks:

- Continuous Multi-Step Block generates
  a signal with smoothly connected flat segments.

- Piece-Wise Constant Block generates
  a piece-wise constant signal.

The blocks use `SignalDesigner.m` which is part of this library.
You can use `SignalDesigner` in MATLAB for programmatic operations.
